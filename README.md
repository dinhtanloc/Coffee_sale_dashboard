## Introduction

The "Coffee sales and marketing" dataset was referenced by our team from the Kaggle platform, which provides a diverse and multidimensional database to support application analysis in the Business Intelligence course. The selection of this topic and dataset is driven by the fact that the coffee industry is gradually becoming one of the fastest-growing business trends in the current market. Collecting and analyzing data in this field helps coffee businesses better understand customer behavior, shape marketing strategies, manage inventory, and optimize business operations.
